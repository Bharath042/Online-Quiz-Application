Online Quiz Application

Features:

1. Dynamic Questions:
   - The code supports dynamic addition of questions, providing flexibility for different quizzes.
   - Sample questions cover various topics related to Java programming and computer science.

2. User-Friendly Interaction:
   - The quiz interface guides the user through each question and validates input.
   - Clear messages and formatting enhance the user experience.

3. Result Display:
   - The `Result` class produces a structured and informative display of the user's performance.
   - Performance categories help interpret the percentage result easily.

Design Choices:

1. Question Class:
   - Text, Options, and Correct Option Index:
     - The `Question` class encapsulates a question's text, options, and the index of the correct option.
     - Using a list for options allows flexibility in the number of choices.
   - Private Access Modifiers:
     - Data members are private, promoting encapsulation and ensuring controlled access.
     - Getter methods provide read-only access to the class's internal state.

2. Quiz Class:
   - List of Questions:
     - Accepts a list of questions as a parameter in the constructor, allowing flexibility and reuse.
   - Separation of Concerns:
     - The `takeQuiz` method is responsible for presenting questions and recording results.
     - A private `getUserAnswer` method handles user input validation.
   - Result Object:
     - Creates a `Result` object to display and calculate quiz results.
     - Utilizes composition to achieve modularity.

3. Result Class:
   - Performance Thresholds:
     - Performance thresholds (e.g., >80% for "Good") are hardcoded for simplicity.
     - Provides a clear and concise summary of the user's performance.
   - Percentage Calculation:
     - The `showPercentage` method calculates the percentage of correct answers.
     - Ensures accurate representation of the user's performance.


4. Main Class:
   - Sample Questions:
     - Demonstrates the usage of the quiz with a set of sample questions.
     - Questions cover a range of topics, promoting variety and testing different knowledge areas.
   - Percentage Thresholds:
     - The threshold for categorizing performance is set based on common grading standards.

Challenges:

1. User Input Validation:
   - Validating user input (e.g., ensuring the user enters a number within the given range) can be challenging. The code addresses this with a do-while loop and exception handling.

2. Hardcoding Thresholds:
   - Hardcoding performance thresholds may not be suitable for all scenarios. A more flexible solution could involve external configuration or user-defined thresholds.

3. Scalability:
   - While the current design handles a moderate number of questions, scalability considerations might be necessary for larger quizzes.

4. Code Reusability:
   - The code promotes reusability by encapsulating functionality within classes. However, further refactoring could enhance modularity and make components even more reusable.

Conclusion:
The provided code establishes a foundation for a console-based quiz application. It balances simplicity with key features and demonstrates object-oriented design principles. Enhancements could include greater configurability, improved user feedback, and increased modularity for scalability.
